# Snake.
#   
# Write a program that emulates Snake
# Initialize your Bitmap Display to 512 x 512 with Unit Height/Width of 8
# Allocate memory in the Heap to hold your 512 x 512 display.
# Draw a nice border that would be the edge of the Etch-A-Sketch - Make it your own.
# Draw a white dot in the exact middle.  
# Initialize any variables you need to hold state.
# Initialize $s0 to hold the current keystroke.  Start with blank
# Draw a random red dot on the screen
# Set the initial color to the color of your choice
# Start an Infinite Loop that will sleep for 500 milliseconds.  Then
#   it will check $s0 to see if a key was pressed.  It will then jump to the handleKey#
#   subroutine to update the screen.  Once that subroutine is finished, it will
#   sleep again for 500 milliseconds.
# Snake Keystrokes - if $s0 holds any of the following keys, then update the screen
#  J says to draw a pixel at the current location and move one to the left
#  K says to draw a pixel at the current location and move down one
#  L says to draw a pixel at the current location and move right
#  I says to draw a pixel at the current location and move up

#  If the red dot is hit, the sleep speed lowers by 20 and a new red dot is drawn on
#  the screen.  This could be tough.  It has to be on a blank pixel.
#  If a line is crossed, the program should blow up.
#  I think this spec is incomplete.  Maybe watch a video on Snake?
